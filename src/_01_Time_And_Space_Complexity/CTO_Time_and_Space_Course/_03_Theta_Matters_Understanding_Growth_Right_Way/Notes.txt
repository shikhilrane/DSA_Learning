Θ (Theta) Notation :
    Theta notation is used to describe the exact growth rate of an algorithm.
    It gives both the upper bound and the lower bound of a function.
    In simple words : Θ tells us how an algorithm really grows.

    If an algorithm is Θ(f(n)), it means : It grows at the same rate as f(n)
                                           Not faster, not slower.

    Mathematical definition : A function T(n) is Θ(f(n)) if there exist positive constants c1, c2, and n0 such that:
        c1 · f(n) ≤ T(n) ≤ c2 · f(n)   for all n ≥ n0
        This means:
            T(n) is sandwiched between two constant multiples of f(n).

    Why Θ is important:
        Gives the most accurate complexity.
        Removes ambiguity between best and worst cases.
        Shows real growth behavior.
        Useful for comparing algorithms precisely.

    Example :
        T(n) = 5n² + 2n + 13

        Table :
            | n   | 5n²    | 2n  | 13 | Total T(n) |
            | --- | ------ | --- | -- | ---------- |
            | 1   | 5      | 2   | 13 | 20         |
            | 10  | 500    | 20  | 13 | 533        |
            | 100 | 50,000 | 200 | 13 | 50,213     |

        Observation:
            As n grows, 5n² dominates.
            2n and 13 become negligible.

        So,
            T(n) ≈ 5n² ≈ n²

        Therefore
            T(n) ∈ Θ(n²)

        One-liner:
            In a polynomial, the term with the highest power of n decides the Θ complexity.
