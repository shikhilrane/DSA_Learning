Θ (Theta) Notation :
    Theta notation is used to describe the exact growth rate of an algorithm.
    It gives both the upper bound and the lower bound of a function.
    In simple words : Θ tells us how an algorithm really grows.

    If an algorithm is Θ(f(n)), it means : It grows at the same rate as f(n)
                                           Not faster, not slower.

    Mathematical definition : A function T(n) is Θ(f(n)) if there exist positive constants c1, c2, and n0 such that:
        c1·f(n) ≤ T(n) ≤ c2·f(n)   for all n ≥ n0
        Lower Bound <= Actual <= Upper bound
        Best Case <= Actual(Theta) <= Worst Case
        This means:
            T(n) is sandwiched between two constant multiples of f(n).

    Why Θ is important:
        Gives the most accurate complexity.
        Removes ambiguity between best and worst cases.
        Shows real growth behavior.
        Useful for comparing algorithms precisely.

    Example :
        T(n) : 5n² <= 5n²+2n+13 <= 8n²

        Table :
            | n   | c₁·g(n) = 5n² | T(n) = 5n²+2n+13 | c₂·g(n) = 8n² |
            | --- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
            | 1   | 5             | 20               | 8             |
            | 2   | 20            | 37               | 32            |
            | 5   | 125           | 148              | 200           |
            | 10  | 500           | 533              | 800           |
            | .   | .             | .                | .             |
            | .   | .             | .                | .             |
            | 100 | 50,000        | 50,213           | 80,000        |

            5n² → lower bound
            8n² → upper bound
            n² → tight bound (Θ) ✅

        Observation:
            As n grows, 5n² dominates.
            2n and 13 become negligible.

        So,
            T(n) ≈ 5n² ≈ n²

        Therefore
            T(n) ∈ Θ(n²)

        One-liner:
            In a polynomial, the term with the highest power of n decides the Θ complexity.
