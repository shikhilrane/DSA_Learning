Big O and Big Omega Notations :
    Why do we need Big O and Big Omega?
        1. Algorithms don't run in exact seconds everywhere
        2. We need a mathematical way to describe performance
        3. Big O And Big Omega helps :
            1. Talks about limits of algorithm performance
            2. Compare algorithms fairly
            3. Ignore hardware, language and OS difference
            4. Define
                Big O -> It talks about how bad it can get
                Big Omega -> It talks about how good it can be
            5. Big O and Big Omega talks about one side only
            6. In Interview, Only Big O is used

Big O Notation :
    Describe maximum growth rate, like it can't be worse than this limit
    It guarantees about worst case
