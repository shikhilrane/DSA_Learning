Time and Space Complexity :
    Time Complexity
    Algorithm 1 --> 1 seconds to execute --> 1 MB space
    Algorithm 2 --> 2 seconds to execute --> 2 MB space

Example :
    If there are two shopping app,
    Algorithm used by Shopping App 1,
        --> 1 seconds to execute --> 1 MB space
            --> 2 seconds to execute = for 1 Lakh user
                --> 3 seconds to execute = for 2 Lakh user
                    --> 4 seconds to execute = for 3 Lakh user
    Algorithm used by Shopping App 2,
        --> 2 seconds to execute --> 2 MB space
            --> 2.5 seconds to execute = for 1 Lakh user
                --> 3 seconds to execute = for 2 Lakh user
                    --> 3.5 seconds to execute = for 3 Lakh user
    Answer : Even though Shopping App 1 is faster for a small number of users, its execution time increases more rapidly as the number of users grows.
             Shopping App 2 starts slower, but its execution time grows more slowly as the number of users increases.
             Therefore, the algorithm used by Shopping App 2 is more efficient because it scales better with increasing input size (users).

Time Complexity =
    It is a time an algorithm takes as the input size increases
Space Complexity =
    It is a additional space/memory than an algorithm uses as the input size increases


Real-World Example
Traffic Signal System
    Small city → Fixed timing traffic lights work fine.
    Big city → Fixed timing causes traffic jams.
    Smart traffic lights (based on traffic density) scale better.
    Same logic: better scalability = better algorithm
