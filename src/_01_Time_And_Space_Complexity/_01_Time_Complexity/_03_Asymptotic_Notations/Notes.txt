Asymptotic Notations :
    There are "Mathematical Tools" used to describe the time and space complexity of an algorithm in terms of "Input Size n". (Unit to describe time and space complexity)

Types of Asymptotic Notations :
    1. Big O (O)            --> Use to represent worst case (IMPORTANT -> We mostly found worst case of the program)
    2. Omega (Ω)            --> Use to represent best case
    3. Theta (Θ)            --> Use to represent average (Tight bound) case (When best case and worst case are the same)
    4. Little o (o)         --> Use to represent upper bound (Algorithm grows slower than the given function)
    5. Little omega (ω)     --> Use to represent lower bound (Algorithm grows faster than the given function)

Why we mostly consider Worst Case scenario? :
If there is a student who is best at History, average at Maths, and worst at Physics, then teacher/parents will focus Physics so that he won't get failed in Physics.
So, Worst-case analysis means we prepare for the maximum problem that can happen, so the system never fails unexpectedly.

Understanding Best-Case(Ω), Average-Case(Θ) and Worst-Case(O) analysis by Linear Search problem :
        int[] n = {3,6,2,5};
        int targetElement = 2;
        for (int i = 0; i < n.length ; i++) {
            if (n[i] == targetElement) {
                System.out.println("target element found at index : " +  i);
            }
        }

        Best Case Scenario : If element found at beginning position of the array, so pointer don't need to traverse whole array
                             best case scenario = Ω(1)
        Average Case Scenario : If element found at middle position of the array, so pointer has to traverse half array and don't need to traverse further
                                average case scenario = Θ(n/2) = Θ(n) by ignoring constants
        Worst Case Scenario : If element found at last position or not found of the array, so pointer has to traverse whole array
                              worst case scenario = O(n)
