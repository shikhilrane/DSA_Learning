Calculating TAS complexity :
    1. In DSA, we don't include class, main method, declarations or definitions while calculating time complexity. Only the core logic or statements that affect execution time are considered.
    2. only Executable statements are responsible for calculating time complexity
        e.g.
            public class UnderstandingTAS {     // Not considered
                public static void main(String[] args) {    // Not considered
                    for (int i = 1; i <= 500; i++) {      // Considered (loop executes)
                        System.out.println("Hello");    // Considered (loop executes)
                    }
                }
            }
    3. When we run a program on different machines or multiple times, the execution time varies de to hardware and system differences. So we measures time complexity in terms of "unit of time" because unit is same for every system, not in seconds or milliseconds etc.
        Why we use “unit of time”
            Execution time varies depending on:
                Hardware
                Operating system
                Load on the machine
            So, instead of seconds or milliseconds, we measure time complexity in “units of time”, which remains consistent across all systems.
        e.g.
            public class UnderstandingTAS {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                            1Unit    1Unit    1Unit
                              ||       ||      ||
                              V        V       V
                    for (int i = 1; i <= 500; i++) {
                        System.out.println("Hello");
                                              ^
                                              ||
                                              1Unit
                    }
                }
            }
            All these executable statements need 1 unit of time to execute

Rules :
    1. Each simple statement takes 1 unit of time
    2. From Java file, Unit of Time section's example 1 and example 2, If there are constant values like 2,4,10,1000, etc. then we can denote it by 1. Because 1 always represents constant.
    3. From Java file, Unit of Time section's example 3, A loop running n times takes n units of time
    4. From Java file, Unit of Time section's example 4, Ignore constants
        If one loop runs 'n' times and the nested loop runs a 'constant' number of times, then time complexity is n * constant, which is simplified to O(n). In TC analysis, constants are ignored, so we represented it as linear time.
        This example can be represented as,
            f(n) = 5n
            f(n) = n
            where, f(n) = mathematical function or simple function
                   n = Time complexity
    5. From Java file, Unit of Time section's example 5, If both inner and outer loop runs n times then it will run n² of times. (Multiply nested loops)
        If one loop runs 'n' times and the nested loop runs a 'n' number of times, then time complexity is n * n, which is simplified to O(n²).
    6. From Java file, Unit of Time section's example 6, Two separate loops, then add their complexity
        If outer loop runs 'n' times and 1st nested loop runs 'n' number of times, then it will be n*n = n²
        If outer loop runs 'n' times and 2nd nested loop runs 'n' number of times, then it will be n*n = n²
        , then time complexity is n²*n² = 2n², by ignoring constants, which is simplified to O(n²).
    7. From Java file, Unit of Time section's example 6, Drop lower power
        The outer loop runs n times
        Inside the outer loop:
            The first nested loop runs n times : Time = n × n = n²
            The second nested loop is a double nested loop : Loop k runs n times
            Loop l runs n times for each k : Time = n × n × n = n³
        Total time complexity : n² + n³
        Time Complexity = O(n³) by ignoring lower term
