Space Complexity :
    1. The space complexity of an algorithm is total space taken by the algorithm with respect to input size. OR Space Complexity measures how memory usage grows as input size increases.
    2. Space complexity include both auxiliary(Temporary) space and space used by an input
    3. Same logic of time complexity is used to find space complexity
    4. Even same annotations are used to denote space complexity
    5. Examples :
        int[] a = new int[n]        -->     S(n) = O(n)
        int[] a = new int[10]       -->     S(n) = O(1)
        int[][] a = new int[n][n]   -->     S(n) = O(n²)

    NOTE : Time complexity is usually considered more important than space complexity,
           because modern systems generally have sufficient memory, but execution time is critical.
